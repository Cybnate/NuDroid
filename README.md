## Welcome to _NuDroid_

__What is _NuDroid_?__

It is a standalone NuBits payment app for your Android device!
Check out the thread in our forum here: https://discuss.NuBits.com/t/proposal-to-develop-a-NuBits-android-wallet-final-version-now-available/691/70


__This project contains several sub-projects:__

 * __wallet__:
     The Android app itself. This is probably what you're searching for.
 * __market__:
     App description and promo material for the Google Play app store.
 * __integration-android__:
     A tiny library for integrating NuBits payments into your own Android app
     (e.g. donations, in-app purchases).
 * __sample-integration-android__:
     A minimal example app to demonstrate integration of NuBits payments into
     your Android app.


__You can build all sub-projects at once using Maven:__

`mvn clean install`
